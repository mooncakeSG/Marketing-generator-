# Prompt Engineering Methodology

This document outlines the prompt engineering methodology used in our AI Marketing Copy Generator project. It details our approach to crafting effective prompts, handling different response types, and optimizing output quality.

## 1. Prompt Design Strategy

### Core Principles
- **Context-First Approach**: Each prompt begins with clear context about the marketing domain and target audience
- **Structured Output Format**: Consistent formatting using markdown for better parsing and display
- **Role-Based Framing**: System acts as an experienced marketing copywriter
- **Temperature Control**: Dynamic adjustment based on task creativity requirements
  - Creative content: 0.7-0.8
  - Structured formats: 0.2-0.3
  - Factual content: 0.1

### Response Type Handling

#### Structured Marketing Copy
```json
{
    "system_context": "Expert marketing copywriter specializing in {industry}",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "format": "markdown",
    "max_tokens": 500
}
```

#### Conversational Flow
```json
{
    "system_context": "Marketing consultant providing guidance",
    "temperature": 0.4,
    "format": "natural dialogue",
    "max_tokens": 150
}
```

#### Creative Generation
```json
{
    "system_context": "Creative director with expertise in {style}",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "format": "creative writing",
    "max_tokens": 1000
}
```

## 2. Prompt Examples

### Example 1: Product Launch Email
```markdown
System: You are an expert email marketing copywriter who specializes in product launches.

User: Write a product launch email for our new AI-powered smartwatch. Target audience: tech-savvy professionals. Key features: health tracking, productivity tools, 7-day battery life.

Role: Email Marketing Specialist
Tone: Professional but engaging
Format: Email with subject line, body, and CTA
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear role definition
- Specific audience targeting
- Structured output requirements
- Balance of technical and benefit-focused content

### Example 2: Social Media Post
```markdown
System: You are a social media marketing expert who creates viral content.

User: Create 3 LinkedIn posts announcing our AI marketing tool. Include hashtags. Focus on pain points it solves: time-saving, consistent quality, multilingual support.

Role: Social Media Strategist
Tone: Professional + conversational
Format: 3 distinct posts with hashtags
Length: Max 280 characters per post
```

**Why it works:**
- Platform-specific formatting
- Multiple variations for testing
- Clear character limits
- Strategic hashtag inclusion

### Example 3: Blog Post Outline
```markdown
System: You are a content strategist specializing in B2B SaaS marketing.

User: Create a detailed blog post outline about "How AI is Transforming Marketing Copywriting". Include statistics, case studies, and actionable takeaways.

Role: Content Strategist
Tone: Authoritative but accessible
Format: Hierarchical outline with H2s and H3s
Elements: Introduction, body sections, conclusion, CTA
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear structural requirements
- Specific content elements
- Balanced tone guidance
- Focus on practical value

## 3. Optimization Techniques

### Testing & Improvement Process
1. **Initial Prompt Testing**
   - A/B testing different prompt structures
   - Collecting user feedback on output quality
   - Measuring completion rates and token usage

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Analyzing failure cases
   - Adjusting temperature and token limits
   - Fine-tuning context and instructions

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated validation of output format
   - Manual review of edge cases
   - User satisfaction metrics

### Common Failure Modes & Solutions

| Failure Mode | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
| Generic Content | Added industry-specific context and examples |
| Inconsistent Format | Implemented strict output templates |
| Off-Brand Tone | Created tone scale (1-10) with examples |
| Technical Jargon | Added readability requirements |

### Example Usage

#### Zero-Shot Example
```markdown
Generate marketing copy for {product} without any examples.
```

#### Few-Shot Example
```markdown
Here are two examples of successful email subject lines:
1. "Transform Your Marketing in 3 Steps"
2. "AI + Creativity = Your Next Campaign Success"

Now generate 5 similar subject lines for {product}.
```
